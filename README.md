# 1. Hardhat Off-Chain Deplyments Base - HHOCDB

Before run anything, make sure you run `npm install`.

This project aims to provide an easy to use _Hardhat base project_ that can be used to develop new smart contracts and then deploy them using the _new tasks provided on top_ of a basic Hardhat project. Basically it provides two main features: _Encryped JSON wallet management_ and _automated offChain deployments_ (regular and TUP Upgradeable). This project is supposed to be used in private and public-permissioned networks, but can be used in public ones changing a few parameters in the gas options.

The structure follows a Hardhat project environment using **ethers**, **waffle** and **chai**. It also use **typescript** and generates smart contract types using **typechain**. The --network parameter refers to the network to be used defined in the [hardhat config file](./hardhat.config.ts).

## 1.4. Deploy Smart contracts

The deployment of smart contracts is managed using Hardhat Tasks. It can be deployed as regular deployments or following the Transparent Proxy upgradeable pattern. The relevant information is recorded in the _deployments.json_ file at the root of project. It is recommended that this file is copied to other location to be able to access them or remember the addresses.

```text
Usage: hardhat [GLOBAL OPTIONS] deploy [--args <JSON>] --password <STRING> [--proxy-admin <STRING>] --relative-path <STRING> [--upgradeable] [contractName]

  --relative-path       Path relative to KEYSTORE.root to store the wallets
  --tx-value            Contract creation transaction value if any
  --upgradeable         Deploy as upgradeable

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS:

  contractName  Name of the contract to deploy (default: "Example_Contract")

```

### 1.4.1. Relevant Constants

- PATH_DEPLOYMENTS: defines the deployments.json file path
- PROXY_ADMIN_NAME: if for some reason you want to change the proxy admin SC name
- PROXY_ADMIN_ADDRESS: this is important. Defines the default already deployed ProxyAdmin to use in upgradeable deployments

# 1. Decentralized Code Trust - Decentralized Trust Framework

_Before run anything, make sure you run `npm install`._

This project is part of the **Decentralized Trust Framework** and it aims to provide a decentralized trust for any address to trust code on Blockchain (Smart Contracts) and know wich code it trust or not. It works for both Externally Owned Accounts EOA and Smart Contracts. If it is used by an EOA it is required a duration for trust (safety reasons). This project is supposed to be used in private and public-permissioned networks, but can be used in public ones changing a few parameters in the gas options. Practical example of usage can be if you have a multiple Smart Contract project and only one is in charge of access, the rest can trust this SC and don't care about access, just limit it to the trusted contracts. But it's usage is generall. There is a Trustable abstract contract (and DumbExample) than can be inherited by this kind of contracts (but, not required).

The structure follows a Hardhat project environment using **ethers**, **waffle** and **chai**. It also use **typescript** and generates smart contract types using **typechain**. The --network parameter refers to the network to be used defined in the [hardhat config file](./hardhat.config.ts).

## 1.4. Deploy Smart contracts

The deployment of smart contracts is managed using Hardhat Tasks. It can be deployed as regular deployments or following the Transparent Proxy upgradeable pattern. The relevant information is recorded in the _deployments.json_ file at the root of project. It is recommended that this file is copied to other location to be able to access them or remember the addresses.

```text
Usage: hardhat [GLOBAL OPTIONS] deploy [--args <JSON>] --password <STRING> [--proxy-admin <STRING>] --relative-path <STRING> [--upgradeable] [contractName]

  --proxy-admin         Address of a deloyed Proxy Admin. Only if --upgradeable deployment
  --relative-path       Path relative to KEYSTORE.root to store the wallets
  --tx-value            Contract creation transaction value if any
  --upgradeable         Deploy as upgradeable

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS:

  contractName  Name of the contract to deploy (default: "Example_Contract")

deploy: Deploy smart contracts on '--network'
```

### 1.4.1. Relevant Constants

- PATH_DEPLOYMENTS: defines the deployments.json file path
- PROXY_ADMIN_NAME: if for some reason you want to change the proxy admin SC name
- PROXY_ADMIN_ADDRESS: this is important. Defines the default already deployed ProxyAdmin to use in upgradeable deployments
